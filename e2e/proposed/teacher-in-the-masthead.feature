Feature: Teacher in the Masthead

    Fundamentally, we think that troubleshooting ought to follow a general progression:
    1. See if you can answer the question yourself (perhaps using the internet)
    2. See if someone 'more senior' can help you

    Many web applications today feature instant messaging services (e.g. Intercom)
    that allow users to get directly in contact with helpful parties from the company
    (though 'helpful parties' usually just means 'the sales people').
    Effectively, these employees are 'more senior' with respect to their knowledge 
    of the company they represent

    Stacy Teecher, a professor teaching an entry-level game development course,
    should be able to set herself up as the 'more senior' person for her students.
